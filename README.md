## Google Search Analysis for Marketing and Research

This project provides an interactive platform for analyzing Google search data to derive actionable insights for marketing and research purposes. Built using **Streamlit** and leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, this system allows users to track trends, forecast future interests, analyze sentiment, and visualize regional and temporal search behaviors.

### Key Features:

* **Search Frequency Analysis**: Track how often specific keywords or themes are searched over time.
* **Trend Forecasting**: Predict future keyword popularity using time-series models like **Prophet**.
* **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**: Classify search queries based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
* **User Intent Classification**: Categorize queries into informational, navigational, or transactional.
* **Geographical Insights**: Visualize search interest distribution across various regions.
* **Multi-modal Input**: Supports text, image, and voice inputs for keyword analysis.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time visualizations of search data using **Plotly**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
* **Automated Reporting**: Generate and download detailed PDF reports of analysis results.

### Technologies Used:

* **Streamlit** for creating the user-friendly web interface.
* **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **TextBlob** and **spaCy** for sentiment analysis and NLP.
* **Prophet** for time-series forecasting.
* **TensorFlow** with **MobileNetV2** for image recognition.
* **Speech Recognition** for converting speech input into text.
